TERM,SCHEMA
Statistical Significance,"The probability that an observed effect or difference in a study is not due to chance. It's often determined by a p-value.; The determination that a drug is effective based on clinical trial data.; associated terms: p-value, Null hypothesis, Type I error"
P-Value,"A measure that helps determine the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis. A low p-value suggests that the observed data would be unlikely under the null hypothesis.; Statistical analysis of gene expression differences.; associated terms: Null hypothesis, Statistical significance, Alpha level"
Confidence Interval,"A range of values derived from sample statistics that is likely to contain the value of an unknown population parameter.; Estimating the mean growth rate of a cultured bacterial population.; associated terms: Margin of error, Confidence level, Sample size"
Randomization,"The process of assigning trial subjects or experimental units to different groups using random methods, minimizing bias and ensuring the groups are comparable.; Random assignment of mice to different treatment groups in a study.; associated terms: Control group, Blinding, Experimental design"
Sample Size,"The number of observations or replicates in a study or experiment, impacting the study's power to detect effects.; Calculating the number needed to observe a difference in drug efficacy.; associated terms: Power analysis, Statistical significance, Confidence interval"
Type I Error,"The incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis, or a false positive result, in hypothesis testing.; Incorrectly concluding that a treatment is effective when it is not.; associated terms: p-value, Type II error, Alpha level"
Type II Error,"The failure to reject a false null hypothesis, or a false negative result, in hypothesis testing.; Failing to detect an actual effect of a treatment due to insufficient power.; associated terms: Power, Beta level, Type I error"
Power Analysis,"The process of determining the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a certain degree of confidence.; Estimating how many plants to measure for assessing nutrient effects on growth.; associated terms: Sample size, Type II error, Statistical significance"
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance),"A statistical method used to compare the means of three or more samples to find out if at least one sample mean is different from the others.; Comparing the growth rates of plants under different light conditions.; associated terms: F-test, p-value, Post hoc tests"
Regression Analysis,"A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.; Analyzing the effect of temperature on enzyme activity.; associated terms: Linear regression, Correlation, Coefficient of determination"
Experimental Design,"The planning of experiments to ensure that the data collected can provide a clear answer to the question being asked, with minimal ambiguity.; Design of a controlled experiment to test the effect of a drug.; associated terms: Control group, Randomization, Replication"
Blinding,"A method used in experiments to prevent bias by ensuring that participants and/or experimenters do not know which treatment or intervention participants receive.; Blinding in clinical trials to evaluate drug efficacy.; associated terms: Double-blind, Randomization, Placebo effect"
Placebo Effect,"The phenomenon where patients experience a perceived or actual improvement in their condition simply because they believe they are receiving treatment.; Measuring drug efficacy when patients receive a sugar pill as a control.; associated terms: Blinding, Control group, Clinical trial"
Null Hypothesis,"A default hypothesis that there is no effect or no difference, and any observed effect is due to sampling variability or chance.; Hypothesis testing in genetic association studies.; associated terms: Alternative hypothesis, p-value, Type I error"
Alternative Hypothesis,"The hypothesis that there is a true effect or difference, opposing the null hypothesis.; Suggesting a new treatment improves patient outcomes compared to standard treatment.; associated terms: Null hypothesis, Statistical significance, p-value"
Chi-Square Test,"A statistical test used to determine the association between categorical variables.; Analyzing the independence of gene frequencies in populations.; associated terms: Contingency table, Expected frequency, p-value"
Logistic Regression,"A regression analysis used to predict the outcome of a categorical dependent variable based on one or more predictor variables.; Predicting the presence or absence of a disease based on risk factors.; associated terms: Odds ratio, Predictor variable, Model fitting"
Cohort Study,"An observational study design where subjects are followed over time to determine how different exposures affect the incidence of a certain outcome.; Tracking the development of disease in populations exposed to different environmental factors.; associated terms: Prospective study, Relative risk, Exposure group"
Cross-Sectional Study,"A study design that analyzes data from a population, or a representative subset, at a specific point in time.; Assessing the prevalence of a disease in a population at a single time.; associated terms: Prevalence, Population survey, Risk factors"
Meta-Analysis,"A method that combines the results of multiple studies addressing a set of related research hypotheses, to derive a more precise estimate of the effect.; Evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment by combining data from several clinical trials.; associated terms: Systematic review, Effect size, Heterogeneity"
