TERM,SCHEMA
T-test,"Definition: A statistical test used to compare the means of two groups to determine if they are significantly different from each other. Types: 1-tailed and 2-tailed t-tests. A 2-tailed t-test is used when no assumption is made about which group will have a higher mean. Calculation: The t-test results in a t-statistic, which is influenced by the difference between group means and the variation within each group. Bigger differences in means, smaller standard deviations, larger sample sizes all result in smaller p-values. Application: Often used in experiments to compare the means of two sets of continuous data. Example: In an experiment comparing correct and incorrect pipetting techniques, a t-test can determine if the observed volumes pipetted are significantly different."
Mean,"Definition: The average value of a set of numbers, calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.
