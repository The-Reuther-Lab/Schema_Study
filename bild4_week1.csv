TERM,SCHEMA
T-test,"Definition: A statistical test used to compare the means of two groups to determine if they are significantly different from each other. Types: 1-tailed and 2-tailed t-tests. A 2-tailed t-test is used when no assumption is made about which group will have a higher mean. Calculation: The t-test results in a t-statistic, which is influenced by the difference between group means and the variation within each group. Bigger differences in means, smaller standard deviations, larger sample sizes all result in smaller p-values. Application: Often used in experiments to compare the means of two sets of continuous data. Example: In an experiment comparing correct and incorrect pipetting techniques, a t-test can determine if the observed volumes pipetted are significantly different."
Standard Deviation,"Definition: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. Calculation: It is calculated using the formula: σ = √(∑ (xi - μ)² / N) where xi is each individual value, μ is the mean of the values, and N is the number of values. Application: Used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion in a data set. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. Example: In lab experiments, standard deviation helps determine the consistency of measurements, such as the volume of liquid pipetted."
Mean,"Definition: The average value of a set of numbers, calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values. Calculation: Mean μ = ∑xi / N, where xi is each individual value and N is the number of values. Application: Used to determine the central tendency of a data set, providing a simple summary of the overall distribution of values. Example: In experiments, the mean volume of liquid pipetted using a specific technique can be compared to determine accuracy and precision."
P-value,"Definition: The probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Threshold: Commonly used thresholds for significance are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, depending on the level of confidence required. Application: Helps determine whether to reject the null hypothesis. A low p-value indicates that the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis. Example: In pipetting experiments, a p-value less than 0.05 might indicate a significant difference in volumes pipetted using different techniques."
Null Hypothesis,"Definition: A hypothesis that proposes no significant difference or effect exists between the groups or conditions being tested. Role in Testing: Serves as the default assumption in statistical hypothesis testing. The goal of the test is to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Example: In an experiment to test the efficacy of different pipetting techniques, the null hypothesis would state that there is no difference in the volume of liquid pipetted using the different techniques."
Alternate Hypothesis,"Definition: The hypothesis that there is a significant effect or difference between the groups or conditions being compared. Role in Testing: Proposes that observations are the result of a real effect, as opposed to random chance. It is the opposite of the null hypothesis. Example: In a study testing the efficacy of a new drug, the alternate hypothesis would state that the drug has a different effect compared to a placebo."
